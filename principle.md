## PPG

**Photoelectric Volume Pulse Waveography (PPG)** is a reflection of visible light (usually green light) in human tissue. It has a visible light source to illuminate the skin, and then uses a photoelectric sensor to collect the light reflected back from the skin. PPG has two modes, transmissive and reflective. Like a typical wrist watch, the light source and the sensor are on the same side, which is reflective. The common ones in hospitals are usually transmissive on the fingertips. The light source and sensor are on different sides.
The ability of the skin itself to reflect light is relatively stable, but the heart pumping blood causes the blood vessel volume to change periodically, causing the reflected light to exhibit periodic fluctuations, especially at the fingertips where the capillaries are very rich. This periodic fluctuation is easily observed.

## Measurement Accuracy

Since the mobile phone flash is generally white light, the signal-to-noise ratio generated in the heart rate detection is not as good as the green light of the professional device, and the algorithm difference is lower than the professional heart rate detection device, so it is only recommended that the heart rate detection such as the heart rate bracelet is not detected. Friends of the device use the app to measure heart rate.
