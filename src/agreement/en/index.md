**IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE THE "Heart Mate" APP FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES.**

The "Heart Mate" app uses the hue difference produced on the camera when the pulse is beating to estimate the heart rate. There may be a certain error in the measurement result, so do not use the app for medical purposes. Once you think there is a problem with your health, please go to a nearby hospital and use professional medical equipment to check your physical health.
