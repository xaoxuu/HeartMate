This is an easy to use handheld heart rate monitor.

Designed for users who don't have a smart bracelet or watch but need to measure heart rate, it's quick and easy to measure and record heart rate. With the Heart Mate Heart Rate Assistant, you can detect and record your heart rate at any time without a heart rate monitoring device such as a smart bracelet. By setting tag tags, you can quickly record the current status, such as after meals, after exercise, etc., to facilitate later retrieval of heart rate data with the same label, to analyze heart rate data under these scenarios, and to find health problems.

## Measurement Principle

**Photo Plethysmo Graphy (PPG)**

PPG is a reflection of visible light (usually green light) in human tissue. It has a visible light source to illuminate the skin, and then uses a photoelectric sensor to collect the light reflected back from the skin. PPG has two modes, transmissive and reflective. Like a general wrist watch, the light source and the sensor are on the same side, which is reflective. The common ones in hospitals are usually transmissive on the fingertips. The light source and sensor are on different sides.
The ability of the skin itself to reflect light is relatively stable, but the heart pumping blood causes the blood vessel volume to change periodically, causing the reflected light to also exhibit periodic fluctuations, especially at the fingertips where the capillaries are very rich. This periodic fluctuation is easily observed.

## Measurement Accuracy

Since the mobile phone flash is generally white light, the signal-to-noise ratio generated in heart rate detection is not as good as that of professional equipment, and the algorithm difference is lower than the professional heart rate detection device. Therefore, only heart rate detection such as heart rate bracelet is recommended. Friends of the device use the app to measure heart rate.
