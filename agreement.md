## Measuring principle

This procedure measures and calculates heart rate values according to **Photoelectric Volume Pulse Waveography (PPG)**.

See Wikipedia: [#Photoplethysmogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoplethysmogram)



## Applicable scene

The significance of this application is that when there are no smart bracelets and smart watches and other professional heart rate monitoring devices, you can use your mobile phone for rough measurements at any time. Therefore, the following scenarios are reasonable:

1. No health problems were found, and I was concerned about my heart rate.
2. I want to know my heart rate range at different times of the day.
3. I want to know how much my heart rate is after exercise.



## Not applicable to the scene

**Once you think there is a problem with your health, please go to a nearby hospital to consult a doctor.**

**The measurement results of this program are for reference only and should not be used for medical purposes.**
